# IntersectionObserver-cards

 This is an exercise about Intersection Observer API from Javascript, an easy and effective way of loading elements when it's in the user screen.

 This exercise was made possible thanks to the knowledge shared by [Web Dev Simplified](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IbRtjez6ag) and [Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/RxnV9Xcw914).

 Thanks for both for making videos about such subjects and sharing for free!
